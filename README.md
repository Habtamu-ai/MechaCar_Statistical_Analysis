# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
# Overview
The main purpose of this project is to investigate AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, which is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress.This project is going to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.The project will perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes,collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots, run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population and finally,design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 


# Results
 - Multiple lineare regression
The result of the multiple linear regression shows except AWD the rest of the production parameters have positive relationship with MPG. Looking at the summary statistics we can say,Vehicle_Length and ground_clearance have positive and significant effect on mpg, and the significance level is at 1% statistican significance.Therefore we  failed to regect the null hypothesis tha vehicle length and ground clearance have no effect on mpg.
